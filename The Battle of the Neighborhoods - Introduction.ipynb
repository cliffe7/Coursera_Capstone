    "New York City, which will be the city used for this project, is one of the most famous cities in the world. Not only for interesting buildings such as Empire State Building and excellent arts scene, but also for its diverse and rich cuisine. NY is a home to hundreds, if not thousands unique restaurants, bars and other food related establishments.\n",

    "What that means is that it's extremely hard to \"break out\" and achieve success. There's no room for error if one wants to not be forced to give up after only a short time. Any major investments, such as starting a restaurant, need to be carefully planned and thought out, not only to maximize the profits, but also to not simply fail."

There are both chain and locally owned restaurants of different sizes in different locations. As such, competition is very steep and one must take into consideration many factors when choosing where to establish their restaurant.\n",

    "Some of the most important factors to consider are:\n",
    "- demographics and population (how many people of what age, gender and ethnicity live in what parts of NY)\n",
    "- competitors in selected area\n",
    "- other entertainment venues close by (cinemas, malls and so on).\n"
